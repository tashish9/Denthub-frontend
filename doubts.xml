<!-- 
  How am i managing the auth in frontend 
  According to me , There's no centre of requests . 
  a request can be request to backend , changing nav . 
  But it can also be limited to  that page only 
  Maybe its a request concernig one small component only 
  Now i dun wanna wait till user makes request to backend till i redirect him
